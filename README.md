# simple-template
This repository contains a simple web page. It's created with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The functionality of the web page is to demonstrate an array of products to the user.
How does it work? - By given array, in js file, we loop through and present each product in flip-cards. By hovering over the card on the background it's given all information about the product. Added blur effect(on the image) for products who are out of stock.
