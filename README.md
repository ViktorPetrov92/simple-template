# simple-template
This repository contains a simple web page. It's created with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The functionality of the web page is to demonstrate an array of products to the user.
How does it work? - By given array, in js file, we loop through and present each product in flip-card. Added blur effect for products who are out of stock.
